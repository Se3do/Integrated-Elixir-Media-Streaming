# Integrated Elixir Media Streaming Service App
Elixir Streaming is a multimedia application built on the JavaFX API, designed to provide a seamless and reliable media streaming experience. Its core architecture and backend functionality are engineered to efficiently handle media content, ensuring smooth playback while offering crucial features for media control and accessibility.

# Key Backend Functionality
- Media Handling:

Elixir Streaming excels at managing media content using the JavaFX Media class, a fundamental component of the JavaFX API. It proficiently retrieves and decodes media from specified URLs, ensuring a fluid playback experience.
- Playback Control:

The application is equipped with a robust playback control system, featuring:
  1. Play/Pause: Core functionality to initiate or halt media playback.
  2. Seek Functionality: Precision in navigating the media timeline, both forwards and backward.
  3. Volume Management: Elixir Streaming efficiently manages volume control, a feature tightly integrated with the JavaFX API. Volume settings are easily adjustable and synchronized with media playback.

# Technical Architecture
- Media Handling:

Elixir Streaming leverages the JavaFX media handling framework, part of the JavaFX API. It utilizes the Media class to initialize and reference media content from designated URLs. The MediaPlayer, another essential JavaFX component, orchestrates the playback process.
- Playback Control:

Event-driven mechanisms, a hallmark of the JavaFX API, govern media playback within Elixir Streaming. Play and pause actions facilitate seamless toggling of playback states, while seek actions enable precise adjustments of the current playback position within the media timeline.
- Volume Control:

Elixir Streaming integrates a volume control mechanism through a slider component, a feature seamlessly bound to the MediaPlayer's volume property provided by the JavaFX API. This ensures a seamless connection between user inputs and audio levels during media playback.
